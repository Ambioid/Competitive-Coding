# Competitive Coding!
Hi! This is a repository where I keep stock of all the competitive coding (recreational coding for events and competitions) that I have done. I am doing this with 2 main goals: To improve my thinking and programming ability. and 2: To become a better coder to stand a good chance in the BIO (British Informatics Olympiad). 

This is me keeping track of my progress to become the best coder I can manage to be. 

Each subfolder will have its own work tracker for that thing in the readme.md

The challenges are tough, so we can try our best. Wish me luck.
